# Walksy's Crystal Optimizer Legit

![icon](https://github.com/michaelScopic/WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit/assets/67214805/96114b0e-da4e-417c-abed-7dc279acddb1)

Fork of [Walksy's Crystal Optimizer](https://github.com/Walksy/WalksyCrystalOptimizer) but without the AC feature because it's considered cheating.

I have no clue how to program in Java, so if this works maybe God does exist. I'm joking I love Jesus.

## Installing

### Pre-warning 

**By downloading this mod straight from the releases page, you trust that I haven't modified the binaries before releasing them (which I haven't). If you do not trust me, compile from source. Instructions are past this section.**

To install this mod, you need a few things:

1. Any Minecraft version with at least 1.19
2. [Fabric Mod Loader](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/) (You will also need the Fabric API of course.)
3. [MidnightLib](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/midnightlib)
4. Any other mod you want to add, as long as they are compatible with each other.
    - **Note:** I do not know of any incompatibilities with Midnight Lib and this mod. If you have errors, it's probably not because of this mod.

Download the mod from the [Releases page](https://github.com/michaelScopic/WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit/releases), and drag it into your mods folder.

Launch the game and spin the block on the opps!! Joking I'm a white city boy so I can't talk like that. Just launch the game and you're good.

### Suggestions/requests
Suggestions and requests can also be made with the [issue tickets](https://github.com/michaelScopic/WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit/issues). Please note that I am nowhere near fluent in Java, so any crazy requests will probably be denied (sorry). 

**I'm not the best at noticing issues on GitHub, so if I don't respond in a timely manner, please DM me on [Discord](https://github.com/michaelScopic#discord).**

## Building from source (optional)

If you want to compile from source because  you just want to build it or if you don't trust my precompiled package, here's how to do it.

To build this mod from source you need a couple of things.

- `git`  (The Git CLI interface [eg: `git clone`, `git pull`, etc]) \*
   - \* Technically optional, you could just download this repo as a [`.zip` file](https://github.com/michaelScopic/WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) (and then extract it) without needing Git.
- Gradle

To install Gradle on Windows, install [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) and then run `scoop install gradle`.

For MacOS, use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), and run `brew install gradle`

For Linux, use your package manager. (Eg: `sudo apt install gradle`, `sudo pacman -S gradle`, `sudo dnf install gradle`, etc)

### In your terminal, run these commands:

#### Windows users:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit
cd WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit

gradlew.bat build
```

#### MacOS/Linux users:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/michaelScopic/WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit
cd WalksyCrystalOptimizerLegit

gradlew build
```

Output `.jar` will be placed in `./build/libs/`.
